This is the issue i got on jenkins pileline:

1. Versionning issue with docker souct, where versoning mismatch.

2. Docker Jenkins permission issue.
    - so we have to add jenkins to docker group or giver docker permission.

3. Docker container already running or already exist.
    - remove the existing container logic is pileline.
    - or use different dynamic name to the container.
